## JavaScript Metrics

JavaScript is huge. JavaScript is wonky. JavaScript is fun!

I wanted a way to both keep track of what I have learned and also discover more about JS.

## Organization

I will be loosely following the organization of the [MDN JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)

## Create-React-App

The good folks at Facebook made a nifty way to start up a React application.

I highly suggest anyone interested in React follow [their instructions](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and set it up. It will take only a few minutes to be coding in React!


## Appearance

The [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) library helps bring us some delicious Material Design.

Full disclosure: I work for [Call-Em-All](https://www.call-em-all.com/), the creators of the MUI library. However, I am not an official contributor to the project (yet).
